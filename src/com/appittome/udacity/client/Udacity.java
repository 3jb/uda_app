/**
 *  <b>Start here</b>:: This is the Activity Class of the Application, 
 *  most of the C from MVC is intended to end up here.
 * <h3>User Interface</h3>
 * The user design constists of 5 screens that appears as follows::
 * <div style="overflow:hidden;width:100%;">
 * <table style="border:0px;padding:0px;height:550px;width:100%;">
 * <tbody style="display:block;overflow:auto;width:840px;height:100%;">
 * <tr>
 * <td>Sign In</td>
 * <td>Course Selection</td>
 * <td>Unit selection</td>
 * <td>Video Selection</td>
 * <td>Youtube video play</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td><img src="../../../../img/20121011_screen_00.png"></td>
 * <td><img src="../../../../img/20121011_screen_01.png"></td>
 * <td><img src="../../../../img/20121011_screen_02.png"></td>
 * <td><img src="../../../../img/20121011_screen_03.png"></td>

 * </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table></div>
 * <p>
 * This class naturally attempts to organize much of the communication
 * between the functional parts of application and the android OS.
 * two main parts of the app require interaction with various parts of the 
 * android os:</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>User Interface</b> requires access to the activity mainly to "inflate" XML resources
 * to create new views that will then be linked back to the appropriate 
 * parent in the display graph.  A seperate UI class ({@link UserInterface}) holds
 * a set of utilites for the UI that access the activity through a subclass 
 * <code>UdacityUserInterface</code> that populates a set of abstract methods to 
 * access critical methods of the acivity, thereby limiting direct dependance and
 * enabling modularity.</p>
 * <p>The second portion of the UI, the {@link SwipeAdapter} is a bit more conventional
 * as it implements a FragmentStatePagerAdapter, that requires the activity (or context)
 * as an argument.</p> 
 * <p>This implementation is disjoint, but came about as a result of itteratively adding
 * complexity.</p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Network Connection</b> required access to a Network oriented Android
 * services available only through the activity.  The method of abstracting the necessary
 * parts to be extended as a subclass of Udacity was used to allow similar benifits to 
 * the User Interface.</p>
 * <p>The third portion included here is intended to act as part of the model:</p>
 * <b>Credentials</b> are included as an extended subclass neededing access between methods 
 * of the credentials, the connection (to test the credentials), and the UI (to request
 * new credentials from the user).  This does not really belong here and should at some
 * time be removed.
 * </p><p>
 * The way it stands the progression though: checking credentials &#62 possibly getting new 
 * credentials &#62 checking credentials &#62 fetch "account.courses_of_interest" &#62
 * bouncing on the course path redirects &#62 "course.get" is all asyncronous and rather 
 * impossible to stop once started as one thing often leads directly to the next.
 * The next evolution should involve listeners (probably here for now, near the
 * [controler/activity]) at each joint to allow more interesting control of the progression.
 * In anycase, a progression usually consists of a static path through methods, and 
 * thereby new paths should be easily enough generated from subclasses of the Async classes
 * in {@link Connection} (JSONPost, JSONGet, and grabPage) wherein onPostExecute can be 
 * implemented to the desired next turn.</p>
